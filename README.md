## Milestone 1 

### Feedback 

Awesome job on Milestone 1, This is the quality I expect from an entry-level programmer that reports to me. Directory structure follows project specifications, the HTML is free of any errors or warnings, and there are no grammatical or spelling mistakes. The only issue I noticed was the disconnect between the purpose and the persona. For the purpose, your target audience is a very small startup, but in the persona, you are targetting a well established Dev Shop. Since the point of your PWP is a portfolio site what type of employer you are targeting does not matter. That being said, remember that the persona builds off the purpose. What you hope to accomplish is well within the scope of the project. Feel free to begin Milestone 2 A
