			<h2>PWP Milestone 2</h2>
			<hr />
			<h3>Content Strategy</h3>
			<p><strong>Landing Page</strong>: My landing page will mostly be a visual space, but will include a list of my best professional abilities and an immediate call to action to contact me or continue to view some references for those professional qualifications.</p>
			<p><strong>Work</strong>: This will highlight some of my predominate strengths, like teaching/coaching, critical thinking, and adaptability as well as previews of some of my work, like the capstone project, my personal webpage, graphic design work, and physical jobs, like carpentry, engineering/design etc.</p>
			<p><strong>Contact</strong>: A simple, secure contact page that will allow a visitor to send me an email after entering their name and email address. On mobile I would like to have for the user to open up their message app and send me a text message.</p>
			<h3>Wireframe</h3>
			<p>I intend to build my site with a Flat UI. I may need to develop a mobile specific interface, as I want the mobile site to be almost exclusive accessible by swiping right to left and left to right, with relevant buttons at the bottom center of the screen. The desktop version of the site will take advantage of the extra real-estate by allowing for collapsible panels, and large, beautiful imagery to be the backdrop for the site.</p>
