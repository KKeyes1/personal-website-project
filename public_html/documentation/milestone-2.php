			<h2>PWP Milestone 2</h2>
			<hr />
			<h3>Content Strategy</h3>
			<p><strong>Welcome</strong>: A bold introduction, possibly an scrolling text running through the "who, what, when, where, why" questions, landing back on Who Is Ken</p>
			<p><strong>navigation</strong>: This section, or perhaps navigation, will use iconography to suggest some things the user can learn about me. Some ideas ideas I have right now, but will hone in on with Daniel and Karen, are of course my new found full stack web development skills, but perhaps also some of my other technical/mechanical knowledge (graphic design, physical security, carpentry, 3-d design etc.), my critical thinking style, personal mission/about me, and a portfolio of my works</p>
			<p><strong>Sections</strong>: mobile and web will be built differently for the sections. Web will simply have full-page sections with a background image as well as the accompanying icon and a blurb with a collapsible panel with more information. Mobile will be built with tiles that swipe from right to left and left to right in a continuous circle. On both mobile and web, navigation will stay on top of these sections with a call to action: "contact me." The Portfolio section, or tile, will allow for images of projects to be displayed that link to the projects where applicable, and have a brief description of the project and result.</p>
			<p><strong>Contact</strong>: Contact me will request the users name and email and send a secure message my professional email address. There will also be links to my relevant online presence, such as gitHub. StackOverflow and LinkedIn. There will also be links present in the footer of the site.</p>
			<h3>Wireframe</h3>
			<p>I intend to build my site with a Flat UI. I may need to develop a mobile specific interface, as I want the mobile site to be almost exclusive accessible by swiping right to left and left to right, with relevant buttons at the bottom center of the screen. The desktop version of the site will take advantage of the extra real-estate by allowing for collapsible panels, and large, beautiful imagery to be the backdrop for the site.</p>
